# Inkai dj web site

Web site is on maintenance ... will be back soon

Inkai is a DJ and producer born in Siberia and based between Brussels and Paris. Her universe blends hard techno, techno-trance, and industrial textures, with fast BPMs (145–160) and a powerful hard groove energy.

Her sets are designed as a hypnotic and visceral trance experience, where frenetic rhythms, explosive sounds, and existential voices merge to create a rare emotional intensity.

On stage, Inkai embodies a minimalist and captivating presence — a balance between raw power and introspection — inspired by modern mysticism and the philosophy of collective power.

Inkai turns each set into a sonic ritual: energetic, hypnotic, and liberating.
